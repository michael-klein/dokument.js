# Introduction

## What is this?

Dokument.js is a documentation generator which runs entirely in your browser. It loads and compiles [.mdx](https://mdxjs.com) (markdown + React JSX) documents and displays them in a beautiful documentation website.

Dokument.js is heavily inspired by [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/), but aims to use .mdx instead of pure markdown and as such is built with [React](https://reactjs.org) instead of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

## Features

- Leverages the power of React components to enhance your documents
- Easy to use (just drop it into your file system and point it to some documents)
- ... but very extensible (Theming, overwriting of Components, plugins...)
- Written in Typescipt

## Roadmap

Dokument.js is not yet read for prime time, so here's a roadmap of features and improvements that we intend to ship:

- markdown-only mode (no JSX) for smaller bundle sizes
  - The MDX runtime adds significant overhead to the bundle size, so a mode that uses just a simple markdown compiler is desireable by some users.
- Explore if there could be a MDX runtime with a significanty smaller memory footprint
